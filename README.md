# Toolkit for AI-Generated Artifacts Detection

This project lays the foundation for a versatile toolkit aimed at detecting artifacts produced by AI-generated content. Initially, the toolkit focuses on AI image detection, using the innovative PatchCraft reference [1] to pinpoint subtle texture discrepancies at the boundaries between low and high texture regions. Future enhancements will extend the toolkit to identify artifacts in other types of AI-generated content.
